Implementation of a webrtc video conferencing application using SimplePeer framework. The project uses npm and vanillaJS.

version #1: There is no signal server, so the connection between the initiator and the other peer is made by manually copying the id to and from. 
When a signal server has been created, this will be routed through the signal server and can be done automatically.
